Store and report warnings and errors in a PoPs database.
PoPs.check() returns a nested list of warning objects:

    >>> warnings = PoPs.check()
    >>> print warnings

May include or exclude specific classes of warning using the filter command.
filter() returns a new context instance:

Or, for easier searching you may wish to flatten the list (to get warnings alone without context messages):
